Setting the Map Bubble Series
-----------------------------
As you can see in the example above, when defining a series, it is necessary to specify the series type for the [mapbubble](https://api.highcharts.com/highmaps/series.mapline) data and the series for the map outline. [Data definition](https://api.highcharts.com/highmaps/series.mapbubble.data) and structure are similar to [bubble chart](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/series.bubble.data) series with properties such as their exact position and name. As with the other map series, they are specified with the [joinBy](https://api.highcharts.com/highmaps/plotOptions.series.joinBy) option.
