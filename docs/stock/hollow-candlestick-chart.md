Candlestick chart
================

A hollow candlestick chart is a slightly modified version of the candlestick series. Similarly, the point is composed of a body and an upper and a lower wick. Also, the open, high, low and close price values are visible however the fill and line color for each candle is different. 


If the closing price is higher than the opening price (bullish) the body is transparent. <br>
When the close is lower than the previous close, the line and filling for bearish candles has a reddish color.<br> 
Else (the close is higher than the previous close), the greenish color is applied for the line and the fill of the bearish candle.
